# Customer-Churn-prediction-using-ANN
Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction: A Python notebook for loading, analyzing, and building machine learning models that predict the likelihood of customers leaving a bank's credit card service, using customer demographics and account features from a real-world Kaggle dataset.

Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction
This repository contains a Python notebook for predicting credit card customer churn using machine learning. Utilizing the Kaggle Churn_Modelling dataset, it demonstrates data loading, exploration, and lays the foundation for building predictive models to help financial institutions identify and retain at-risk customers.

Features
Loads customer churn data from Kaggle (Churn_Modelling.csv).

Analyzes demographic and account information (e.g., credit score, geography, age, balance, tenure, products, card status).

Prepares data for machine learning and churn prediction tasks.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle credit-card-customer-churn-prediction

Columns: RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary, Exited ("Exited" indicates churn).
